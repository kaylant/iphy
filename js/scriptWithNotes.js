// ----------- Event Listeners -------------- //

window.addEventListener("hashchange", hashController)
// The hashchange is a special event. The hashchange means that as soon as the words ater the # changes, the window will invoke a certain function, in this case the hashController.

scrollButton.addEventListener("click",changeView) 
// Click is our event. When the scroll button is clicked the changeView function will be invoked. 

infoGridButton.addEventListener("click",changeView)
// Click again is our event. When the infoGrid button is clicked, the changeView function will yet again be invoked.


// ----------- Kick things off! -------------- //

hashController() // If the page is being loaded for the first time, there is no hash*change* event! so, 
// in this example, we manually invoke the hashController on the first page load. this is not always
// the way things will happen.
